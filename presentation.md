Notes:

* Currently working for Kenetic, a HK-based company trading cryptocurrencies.
* End-to-end trading system
* Majority of the code in Python, but the fats bits in C++
* This presentation is about data types used in the C++ to store financial values
* I'm going to show excerpts from actual production code

Notes:

* What values do we need to store?
 - price depth, trades, postions
* On this picture: Hubi BTc/USDT, 2020-04-25 16:03
* Introducing price depth:
    - Simple price is not enough
    - At the core of every exchange as a device called 'matching engine'
    - Matching engine stores all active orders for an instrument (order book)
    - When new order is entered, it is matched with existing orders
    - Example - buying or selling 1 BTC
    - If there is no match, the order (possibly) joins the book
    - If the uis a match, trade happens
    - What we dee is 'price depth', a view of the oder book

## Price depth

``` cpp
using Price = ???;
using Quantity = ???;

struct DepthLevel {
  Price mPrice;
  Quantity mQty;
};

using DepthLevels = std::vector<DepthLevel>;

struct Depth {
  DepthLevels mBids; // sorted by price, descending
  DepthLevels mAsks; // sorted by price, ascending 
};
```

====

## Requirements for the type

* Exact ==
* Comparison, <, <=, >, >=
* Arithmetics: +, -, +=, -=
* No loss of precision!
* conversion to/from string

Notes:

* The type must be fast. If don;t need speed, we use Python
* Depth diffs and multi-depth operations require operators to be fast!

====

## What are the options

1. floating point numbers
2. fixed point numbers
3. decimal floating point
4. arbitrary precision

Notes:

These are the options that come to mind when looking for a suitable type.

====

### Floating point types

float, double : IEEE 754

Notes:

* We have our good'ol floating point types built into the language and the CPU

====

### Floating point types

Pros:

* Fast
* Available out of the box

Notes:

* The built-in floating point types are fast, they are handled by the CPU itself (on arch of interest, ie x86-64)
* They are readily available, with the entire complement of operations

====

### Floating point types

Cons

* Inexact equality comparison
* Silent loss of precision

_What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic_

Notes:

* There is a fantastic article called _What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic_

====

### Floating point types

Bad at storing decimal numbers

``` cpp
0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
```

Notes:

* Example form the article
* Floating point numbers are famously bad at storing decimal fractions

====

### Floating point types

Inexact comparison

```cpp
double a = parse1("1234.56789");
double b = parse2("1234.56789");
assert(a == b);

std::map<double, T> map;
map[a] = data;
assert(map.find(b) != map.end());
```

Notes:

* The build-in comparison is bitwise
* The same value, after some operations, can slightly differ
* Even using different string parser, ie JSON vs database input, can yield different bits
* The solution: create a "compare with tolerance", but this is slow (and incorrect)
* Trying to use double as a key in a map is an invitation to a world of pain
* I've seen this done, working for years, and then suddenly not working in mature, production code,
* ... poor programmers looking for a for a fix whole night
